# PolynomialGraphs

PolynomialGraphs is a library which contains two gems - polinomial_calculus and trigonometric_calculus, which can help you to build graphs of polinomial and trigonoimetric (sin, cos, tg, ctg) functions and integrate them.
It's easy to use it by running on your localhost.

# Ruby Version

3.3.8

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

to use polynomial functions:
```bash
bundle add polynomial_calculus    

to use triginimetric functions:
```bash
bundle add trigonometric_calculus  

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install polynomial_calculus

```bash
gem install trigonometric_calculus

## Usage

Run your code locally, after that you can use your localhost to build graphics in web-browser.
